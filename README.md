## 👋 Welcome message

**I am happy you found your way to my GitHub profile page!**

My name is Georg and I am a computer science professor, software engineer, and entrepreneur from Bavaria, Germany living in Upper Austria, Austria. On my GitHub profile you find information about my software projects, including:

* [**CADdrive** - A modern product design platform for schools and universities](https://caddrive.org)<br/>Designing awesome products in larger teams is a valuable skill in today's economy. However, developing product design and teamwork skills is a rather difficult endeavor for different reasons. To overcome existing barriers in the learning journey, we are developing CADdrive, an easy-to-use and modern Web-based platform for product design with state-of-the-art product design functionality.
* [**Mentawise** - An innovative knowledge management solution for visual people](https://mentawise.com)<br/>If you like mind mapping, knowledge graphs, and graph visualization, Mentawise might be your thing! Mentawise is a platform for quickly building your own knowledge graphs and shareing them with other people. The knowledge graph approach is much easier than traditional note taking, because the structure of your knowledge graph is fluid, while the structure of your notes is rigid.

Feel free to contact me via GitHub or other social network platform, which I am using actively! I am always happy to learn new things from different people and share my experience with everybody who is interested!
